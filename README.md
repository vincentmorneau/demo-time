# Starter Project Template

Use this repo to start a new project.

In Github simply click the "Use this template" button.

Otherwise, you will likely want to **download** and not clone or fork. Then you can `git init` and start a new repo.

Follow the steps below to configure and initialize.

## Setup

* Run `cd scripts; sh config.sh` (or `config.bat`)
* Setup `apex/_ins.sql` with the correct Workspace & App Number
* Decide if your project will use a static or dynamic template `_release_template_static.sql` or `_release_template_dynamic.sql`.  You could optionally delete one of them.
* Generate for your `_release.sql` script [ASCII Art](https://asciiartgen.now.sh/?style=standard)
* Optionally remove directories that won't apply (ie. conversion)

## Getting Started

Start a new release:
* Run commands like the following depending on a static or dynamic release

```
rm ../release/[a-z]*.sql
cp ../release/_release_template_static.sql ../release/_release.sql
```


```
rm ../release/[a-z]*.sql
cp ../release/_release_template_dynamic.sql ../release/_release.sql
```


* Optionally modify `script/new.sh` as needed

```
sh scripts/new.sh
```

## Release Autocomplete

_Note: This script was developed by [Insum Solutions](https://insum.ca)._

**Status: POC**

The release.js file is node.js application will automatically add files in the defined directories (like `views`, `packages`, `triggers`) into a release file.  Adjust the `releaseObjects` JSON structure to match your needs. The directories will be processed in order thus allowing for the correct resolution of dependencies.

### Release File Configuration

You must make sure that the following is included in your release file:

```sql
-- AUTOREPLACE_START
-- AUTOREPLACE_END
```

The code will automatically fill in the section between these lines.

### Run

`node ./release/release.js ./release/<release file>`


Example:

```bash
# Go to releases folder in trunk/master of current SVN/Git project
cd releases

node release.js _release.sql
```

This application can be run multiple times as it keeps the substitution strings.
